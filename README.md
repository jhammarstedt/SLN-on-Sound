# SLN with noise

A reimplementation of the Semi-supervised Learning paper on [Stochastic Label Noise](https://github.com/chenpf1025/SLN) on the [FSD50K](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00475)
sound dataset.

Sound data preprocessing and networks are credited to: https://github.com/SarthakYadav/fsd50k-pytorch
Minor edits and workarounds were added to the code to make it work as intended in this scenario
